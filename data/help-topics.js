            <p>Browse comparable projects to ground your targets in real data. The grid shows one card per project with an image, overall $/SF, and GSF. Clicking a card expands in place and reveals a per-system table with $/SF and system details.</p>
            <p>Benchmark indicators also appear inside the <strong>Target Values</strong> and <strong>Interiors</strong> charts as blue markers at each system's $/SF. Hover them there for project-specific context.</p>

            <p>The table below updates each component's SF based on these choices (e.g., <em>Roofing</em> uses footprint, <em>Enclosure</em> scales with perimeter Ã— floors, <em>Interiors/Equipment</em> track finished floors). You can also edit per-component SF directly.</p>
            <p>Indirect costs are calculated from imported percentages. The Grand Total reflects Cost of Work + Indirects, and the header shows the variance to GMP.</p>
